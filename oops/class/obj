Here’s a comprehensive list of interview questions on Objects and Classes in Java, covering a range of difficulty levels and practical examples.

Basic Questions
What is a class in Java?

A class is a blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines the attributes (fields) and behaviors (methods) that the objects created from the class will have.
What is an object in Java?

An object is an instance of a class. It represents a real-world entity with state (attributes) and behavior (methods).
What is the relationship between a class and an object in Java?

A class defines the structure and behavior, while an object is an actual instance of that class, with specific values for the attributes.
How do you create an object in Java?

You use the new keyword to create an instance of a class.
java
Copy code
ClassName obj = new ClassName();
What is the default constructor in Java?

A default constructor is a no-argument constructor provided by Java if no other constructors are defined. It initializes objects with default values (e.g., null for objects, 0 for integers).
Intermediate Questions
Can a class have multiple constructors?

Yes, a class can have multiple constructors (constructor overloading) with different parameter lists.
What is the this keyword in Java?

The this keyword refers to the current object. It is used to refer to instance variables or invoke other constructors in the same class.
What is the role of the new keyword in object creation?

The new keyword allocates memory for the object on the heap and calls the constructor to initialize it.
Can an object be created without using the new keyword?

Yes, you can create an object using methods like clone() or by deserializing an object, though new is the most common method.
What is the significance of the final keyword when applied to a class, method, or variable?

final class: Cannot be subclassed.
final method: Cannot be overridden.
final variable: The value cannot be changed once initialized.
What are instance variables and local variables in Java?

Instance variables: Variables declared in a class but outside methods; each object has its own copy.
Local variables: Variables declared inside methods or constructors; they are temporary and only exist during the method execution.
What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable?

Class variables are shared among all instances of the class (declared static).
Instance variables are unique to each object created from the class.
What is method overloading?

Method overloading is when multiple methods in the same class have the same name but different parameter lists (number or type of parameters).
What is method overriding?

Method overriding occurs when a subclass provides a specific implementation of a method already defined in its superclass.
What is a static method in Java?

A static method belongs to the class rather than an instance of the class. It can be called without creating an object.
Advanced Questions
What is a constructor in Java, and what is its purpose?

A constructor initializes an object when it is created. It has the same name as the class and no return type.
What is the purpose of the super keyword in Java?

The super keyword refers to the superclass of the current object. It is used to access superclass constructors, methods, and fields.
Can you call a constructor explicitly in Java?

Yes, using the new keyword or the super() method in the constructor of a subclass.
What happens if you don’t define a constructor in a class?

If no constructor is defined, Java provides a default constructor (no arguments) that initializes the object with default values.
What is the significance of the Object class in Java?

The Object class is the root of the Java class hierarchy. Every class in Java inherits from the Object class. It provides essential methods like toString(), equals(), and hashCode().
What is the difference between shallow copy and deep copy in Java?

Shallow copy: Copies the values of the original object, but for objects within, only references are copied.
Deep copy: Creates a new object and recursively copies all objects inside the original object.
What is object serialization in Java?

Serialization is the process of converting an object into a byte stream for storage or transmission. Deserialization is the reverse process.
What is the difference between clone() and the new keyword in object creation?

clone() creates a copy of an existing object, while new creates a new instance from the class.
What is the role of a static block in Java?

A static block is used to initialize class-level data when the class is loaded into memory.
Can a class be abstract and still have constructors?

Yes, an abstract class can have constructors, which are called when a subclass is instantiated.
Practical/Scenario-Based Questions
How would you design a class for a “Car” with attributes like color, make, and model, and behaviors like start() and stop()?

Define the Car class with appropriate constructors, attributes, and methods.
How would you design a Book class to handle attributes like title, author, and price, and provide methods for displaying book details and applying a discount to the price?

Create the Book class with private fields, constructors, and methods like getDetails() and applyDiscount().
Can you demonstrate method overloading with a calculateArea() method for different shapes (circle, rectangle)?

Example:
java
Copy code
class AreaCalculator {
    public double calculateArea(double radius) {
        return Math.PI * radius * radius; // Circle
    }

    public double calculateArea(double length, double width) {
        return length * width; // Rectangle
    }
}
How would you create a class Employee with methods to display employee information and calculate salary, while ensuring employee data is protected?

Use encapsulation to protect fields and provide public getter/setter methods.
Design a Student class with fields for name, id, marks, and methods to calculate the total marks and average score.

Example:
java
Copy code
class Student {
    private String name;
    private int id;
    private int[] marks;

    public Student(String name, int id, int[] marks) {
        this.name = name;
        this.id = id;
        this.marks = marks;
    }

    public int calculateTotal() {
        int total = 0;
        for (int mark : marks) {
            total += mark;
        }
        return total;
    }

    public double calculateAverage() {
        return calculateTotal() / (double) marks.length;
    }
}
Coding Examples
1. Creating an Object and Calling Methods
java
Copy code
class Person {
    private String name;
    private int age;

    public Person(String name, int age) {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
    }

    public void introduce() {
        System.out.println("Hello, I am " + name + " and I am " + age + " years old.");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Person person1 = new Person("Alice", 30);
        person1.introduce(); // Output: Hello, I am Alice and I am 30 years old.
    }
}
2. Constructor Overloading Example
java
Copy code
class Rectangle {
    private double length;
    private double width;

    public Rectangle() {
        this.length = 1.0;
        this.width = 1.0;
    }

    public Rectangle(double length, double width) {
        this.length = length;
        this.width = width;
    }

    public double area() {
        return length * width;
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Rectangle rect1 = new Rectangle();
        System.out.println("Area of default rectangle: " + rect1.area());

        Rectangle rect2 = new Rectangle(5.0, 3.0);
        System.out.println("Area of custom rectangle: " + rect2.area());
    }
}
3. Static Methods Example
java
Copy code
class MathUtil {
    public static int add(int a, int b) {
        return a + b;
    }

    public static int multiply(int a, int b) {
        return a * b;
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println(MathUtil.add(5, 3)); // Output: 8
        System.out.println(MathUtil.multiply(5, 3)); // Output: 15
    }
}
